# Description
The plugin does not sanitize or escape form values before saving to the database or when outputting, which allows high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed.

# Proof of Concept
Navigate to `Tickets > Add New >  add all information on the title, post, Ticket type, Ticket priority, Ticket status > click update` and intercept the request using burp suite. The parameters `"wats_select_ticket_type"`, `"wats_select_ticket_priority"`, `"wats_select_ticket_status"` can be injected with cross-site scripting (XSS), such as `test"><script>alert('test')</script>;` `test"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script> payload`. Next Click Forward on burp suite. To trigger the XSS payload, Open the permalink post/ticket page.
