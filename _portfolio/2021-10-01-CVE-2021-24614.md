# Description
The plugin does not sanitise or escape Service Prices before outputting it in the List, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed.

# Proof of Concept
In the admin dashboard navigate to `Services > Add service` and put the following payload in the Price (Service Params section): 

```text
<script>alert('test')</script>
```
The XSS will be triggered in the Services list `/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=services`
