# Description
The plugin does not sanitize or escape form fields before outputting it in the List, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed.

# Proof of Concept
Navigate to `WP Ticket > Forms >  edit layout of "Open a Ticket" or "Search Tickets" > on "Editing Form" Setting menu`.

Select a form field and you can edit the "Label" with a cross-site scripting (XSS) payload such as
```text
v < 5.10.3 - "><script>alert(/XSS/)</script> 
v <= 5.10.3 - " style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
```
All of the parameters on the "Editing Form" are vulnerable.To trigger the XSS payload, refresh the "Editing Form" page.
