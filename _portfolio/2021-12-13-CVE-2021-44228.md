# Description
The Log4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) ultimately is a quite simple JNDI Injection flaw, but in a really really bad place. Log4J will perform a JNDI lookup() while expanding placeholders in logging messages (or indirectly as parameters for formatted messages) - readmore [PSA: Log4Shell and the current state of JNDI injection](https://mbechler.github.io/2021/12/10/PSA_Log4Shell_JNDI_Injection/).
