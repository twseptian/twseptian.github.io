Welcome to my small corner of the internet. I’m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/twseptian/">Tri Wanda Septian</a>, still learning and exploring in the fields of Information Security, Penetration Testing, heterogeneous networks. From time to time, I also share little notes from my journey into Data Science and Machine Learning. This blog is simply a place to collect what I learn along the way—nothing perfect, just continuous growth.
